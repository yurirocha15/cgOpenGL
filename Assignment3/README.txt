To run the code, just go to the terminal and run the shell script:

    ./run.sh

If the file is not allowed as an executable, you can run:

    chmod +x run.sh

and then run it.

If you do not want to run the script, you can type the commands manually:

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./test
